# April Tags vs YOLOv5
- compare performance for both April Tag (id 0) and YOLOv5 model in terms of their detection accuracy, average speed of detection and their memory requirements.

## Equipments
-	The experiments are tested using a logitech webcam C922 (1920x1080 resolution and 30 fps) laptop with specs:
  - i7-1165G7
  - 16GB RAM
  - NVIDIA GeForce MX450
  
## Accuracy vs Distance
### April Tag
- id 0 with size of 0.123m 

| Actual Distance (m) | Measured Distance (m) | Percentage Error (%) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------| 
|1.25|1.225|2| 
|2.50|2.438|2.48|
|3.75|3.674|2.03|
|5.00|4.918|1.64|
|6.25|6.183|1.07|
|7.50|7.440|0.8|
|8.75|7.440|0.81|
|10.00|9.913|0.87|
|10.80 (maximum range)|10.815|0.14|

### YOLOv5
- tested to detect a person

| Actual Distance (m) | Accuracy (1 or 0) | Confidence (%) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------| 
|3.75|1|0.93|
|5.00|1|0.92|
|5.00|1|0.92|
|7.50|1|0.90|
|8.75|1|0.87|
|10.00|1|0.83|
|11.25|1|0.70|
|12.50|1|0.81|
|13.75|1|0.54|
|15.00|1|0.41|
|16.25|1|0.80|
|17.50|1|0.65|
|18.75|1|0.65|
|20.00|1|0.50|
|21.25|1|0.50|
|22.50|1|0.50|
|23.75|1|0.60|
|25.00|1|0.70|
|26.25|1|0.60|

- the limit of the YOLOv5 for detecting a person is pretty far and should be enough for object detection in F1Tenth
- as this experiment is to detect a person and the size of a person is much larger than a F1Tenth car, the limit of detection distance should be shorter

## Average Speed of Detection (Topic Publishing Speed)
### April Tag
- /tag_detections: 13.39Hz

### YOLOv5
- /yolo_result_out: 12.50Hz


## CPU Memory Requirement
### April Tag
- 1.21%

### YOLOv5
- 20.45%
- 1.6GB / 2GB (GPU Memory)

## Possible Modifications
- use stereo camera models so depth information can be obtained using camera
- april tag requires the tag to be printed and attached to all objects for detection, which is not really practical in real-life situation

## Conclusion
- After analyzing the data, we recommend using YOLO as it is more robust with a farther range of detection compared to April Tags. Despite having a 20x memory requirements, a camera sensor can be generalized to work on more tasks other than just object detection. Moreover, we canâ€™t expect to put an April tag on all of our opponent's car so we have decided to use YOLO.
